      product: this.assessProductRisk(client.products),
      delivery: this.assessDeliveryChannelRisk(client.channel),
      client: this.assessClientTypeRisk(client.type)
    }

    return this.calculateOverallRisk(factors)
  }

  // Geographic risk assessment
  assessGeographicRisk(location: Location): RiskScore {
    const highRiskJurisdictions = [
      'Iran', 'North Korea', // FATF blacklist
      'Myanmar', 'Syria', // Enhanced monitoring
      // ... other high-risk countries
    ]

    if (highRiskJurisdictions.includes(location.country)) {
      return { score: 10, level: 'High' }
    }

    // Assess based on corruption index, AML standards
    return this.calculateGeographicScore(location)
  }

  // Enhanced due diligence triggers
  requiresEDD(client: Client): boolean {
    return (
      client.riskLevel === 'High' ||
      client.isPEP ||
      client.hasAdverseMedia ||
      client.complexStructure ||
      client.location.isHighRisk
    )
  }
}
```
