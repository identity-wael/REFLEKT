# System Modeling Overview

The system modeling documentation provides comprehensive diagrams and models that illustrate REFLEKT's credit improvement platform architecture. These diagrams detail how AI-powered chat interactions, credit monitoring, and financial recommendations work together to help users improve their credit scores.

## Diagram Types

### Flowcharts
Step-by-step process flows for key credit operations including:
- Chat conversation flow with GPT-4o (primary) and Claude 3 Opus (alternative)
- Credit score analysis pipeline
- Improvement plan generation workflow
- User onboarding and authentication

### Sequence Diagrams
Time-ordered interactions between system components showing:
- AI chat message processing with multi-model support (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus)
- Credit bureau API integration flows
- Tool execution for credit operations
- Real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets

### State Diagrams
State transitions for critical system components:
- Chat session state management
- User authentication states
- Credit monitoring lifecycle
- Action plan execution states

### Entity Relationship Diagrams
Data model relationships and schemas including:
- User profile and credit data models
- Chat conversation history structure
- Credit score tracking schemas
- Action plan and recommendation models

### Component Interaction Diagrams
Detailed service communication patterns showing:
- Multi-model AI tool calling architecture (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus)
- Credit service orchestration
- Notification system flows
- Real-time data synchronization

## Navigation Guide

Each diagram type has its own dedicated section with:
- High-resolution diagrams using Mermaid
- Detailed explanations of each component
- Implementation notes and best practices
- Credit-specific design patterns

## Color Coding

All diagrams use a consistent color scheme for clarity:
- Blue (#3B82F6) - Frontend and UI components
- Purple (#8B5CF6) - AI and GPT-4o components
- Green (#10B981) - Data and storage layers
- Orange (#F59E0B) - External services (Credit bureaus, Plaid)
- Red (#EF4444) - Error states and alerts

## Key System Models

### 1. Credit Intelligence Model
Illustrates how credit data flows through the system:
- Data ingestion from credit bureaus
- AI-powered analysis and insights
- Personalized recommendation generation
- Progress tracking and monitoring

### 2. AI Conversation Model
Shows the multi-model AI integration architecture:
- Message processing pipeline
- Tool execution framework
- Context management system
- Response streaming mechanism

### 3. User Journey Model
Maps the complete user experience:
- Onboarding and authentication
- Initial credit assessment
- Ongoing monitoring and advice
- Goal achievement tracking

### 4. Security Model
Details the security architecture:
- Authentication flow with Firebase
- Data encryption patterns
- PII handling and protection
- Audit logging and compliance

## Implementation Standards

All system models follow these standards:
- **Notation**: UML 2.0 for consistency
- **Tools**: Mermaid for version-controlled diagrams
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex flows
- **Updates**: Models kept in sync with codebase

## Usage Guidelines

When reviewing these models:
1. Start with the overview diagrams for context
2. Drill down into specific components as needed
3. Cross-reference with API documentation
4. Use models for troubleshooting and optimization

## Model Validation

All models are validated against:
- Current implementation in codebase
- API specifications and contracts
- Database schemas and migrations
- Business requirements and user stories
