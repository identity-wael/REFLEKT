## Best Practices for Caregivers

### Setup Recommendations

1. **Initial Configuration** (with user if possible):
   - Upload family photos with labels
   - Record life story highlights
   - Set medication schedule
   - Define safe zones
   - Configure alert preferences

2. **Environment Optimization**:
   - Place mirror where user sees it naturally
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Remove mirrors elsewhere (can be confusing)
   - Keep area uncluttered

3. **Routine Establishment**:
   - Consistent times for activities
   - Same phrases for common tasks
   - Regular mirror interaction times
   - Gradual introduction, not overwhelming

### Communication Tips

**Effective Interaction**:

```
DO:
✓ "Good morning, Margaret!" (use name)
✓ Simple, one-step instructions
✓ Patient pauses for response
✓ Validating feelings
✓ Positive reinforcement

DON'T:
✗ "Don't you remember?"
✗ Complex multi-step instructions
✗ Arguing about reality
✗ Rushing responses
✗ Infantilizing language
```

### Ethical Considerations

**Autonomy vs. Safety**:
- Balance independence with necessary supervision
- Involve user in decisions when possible
- Respect dignity always
- Don't over-monitor

**Privacy**:
- REFLEKT doesn't record audio/video without explicit consent
- Caregiver access is logged and transparent
- User (or legal representative) controls data

## Troubleshooting

**Q: User doesn't recognize REFLEKT**

- A: Reduce reminder frequency
- A: Use gentler language
- A: Switch to music/photos instead of verbal prompts

**Q: Not responding to voice commands**
- A: May need caregiver to initiate interactions
- A: Use touch interface instead
- A: Set to automatic prompts (doesn't require user input)

**Q: Caregiver alerts too frequent**
- A: Adjust sensitivity in app settings
- A: Customize which behaviors trigger alerts
