# Voice Assistant

REFLEKT's **Voice Assistant** enables completely hands-free interaction with your smart mirror. Using advanced voice recognition and natural language processing, you can control modes, request information, manage your schedule, and get wellness support—all through simple voice commands while getting ready.

## Overview

The Voice Assistant makes REFLEKT truly effortless. Whether your hands are busy with morning routines or you simply prefer voice interaction, REFLEKT understands and responds to natural language commands with intelligence and context awareness.

### Key Features

### Conversational Context

REFLEKT remembers conversation flow:

User: "What's on my calendar today?"
REFLEKT: "You have 3 meetings..."

User: "What about tomorrow?"  ← Understands "calendar" context
REFLEKT: "Tomorrow you have 2 events..."

User: "Cancel the first one"  ← Knows which "first" meeting
REFLEKT: "Canceling your 9 AM standup tomorrow. Done."
```

### Multi-Intent Handling

Process complex commands:

```
User: "Show me what to wear for my client meeting and
       tell me the weather"

REFLEKT: "Your client meeting is at 11:30 AM. The weather
          will be 68° and sunny.

          I recommend business professional - here are
          three outfit options suitable for the weather..."
```

### Clarification Requests

REFLEKT asks for clarification when needed:

```
User: "Cancel my meeting"
REFLEKT: "You have 3 meetings today. Which one would you
          like to cancel?"
User: "The afternoon one"
REFLEKT: "Canceling your 2 PM department meeting. Should I
          send a notification to attendees?"
```

### Error Handling

Graceful handling of misunderstandings:

```
User: [unclear audio]
REFLEKT: "I didn't quite catch that. Could you repeat?"

User: "Play music" [but no music service connected]
REFLEKT: "I don't have a music service connected yet.
          Would you like me to guide you through setup?"
```

## Use Cases

### Hands-Free Morning Routine

[After 3-minute breathing]

REFLEKT: "Great job. Ready for your day?
          You have 3 meetings today, starting at 9 AM.
          Weather is 70° and sunny.
          I suggest business casual - should I show you options?"

User: "Yes"
[REFLEKT displays AR outfits]

User: "Option two looks good"
REFLEKT: "Perfect. I'll save that outfit.
          Have a wonderful day!"

Total interaction: Completely hands-free
```

### Quick Information

**Scenario**:
```
User (while brushing teeth): "What's the weather?"
REFLEKT: "72° and sunny with a high of 78° today"

User: "Traffic to work?"
REFLEKT: "15-minute delay on Highway 101 due to accident.
          I recommend leaving 10 minutes earlier than usual."
```

```

- A: Ensure you're within 10 feet of mirror

**Q: Commands are frequently misunderstood**
- A: Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- A: Reduce background noise
- A: Retrain voice profile in Settings → Voice → Voice Training

**Q: Response is too slow**
- A: Switch to on-device processing for faster response
- A: Check internet connection (for cloud processing)
- A: Close unnecessary apps

**Q: REFLEKT interrupts conversations**
- A: Increase wake word sensitivity threshold

- A: Mute microphone when not in use

## Best Practices

### Optimal Usage

1. **Speak naturally**: No need for robot-like commands
2. **Use wake word clearly**: Pause briefly after "Hey REFLEKT"
3. **Be specific**: "Cancel my 2 PM meeting" vs. "Cancel meeting"
4. **Provide context**: "Show outfit for client meeting" vs. "Show outfit"
5. **Give feedback**: Say "That's not right" to help improve accuracy

### Voice Command Tips

```
Better: "What should I wear for my client presentation?"
Worse: "Clothes"

Better: "Add doctor appointment Thursday at 3 PM"
Worse: "Add appointment"

Better: "Start 5-minute calm breathing session"
Worse: "Breathe"
```
