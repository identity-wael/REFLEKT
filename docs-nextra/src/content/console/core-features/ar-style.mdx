### Body Mapping

REFLEKT creates a 3D model of your body:

1. **Skeletal Detection**: Identifies body joints and posture
2. **Body Measurements**: Estimates dimensions (height, shoulders, waist)
3. **Movement Tracking**: Follows your movements in real-time
4. **Depth Sensing**: Creates accurate 3D representation

**Privacy Note**: Body mapping is temporary and deleted after session. No body images are stored.
